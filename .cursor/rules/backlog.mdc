# How the agent MUST work
1. Read .backlog/tasks.json.
2. Choose the lowest-ID task whose
   • status == "TODO", and
   • every ID in `deps` is "DONE".
3. Open .backlog/tasks/<id>.md.
4. Set status="IN_PROGRESS" in tasks.json; `git add -u .`.
5. Implement **only** that spec. Run tests.
6. If passing: set status="DONE", `git commit -am "task <id>: <title>"`.
7. Loop back to step 1.

# Hard rules
- Never edit files for tasks already DONE.
- Obey all style-guard rules (classNames, layout) in this repo.
