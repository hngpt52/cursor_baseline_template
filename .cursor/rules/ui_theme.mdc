• Colours, radii, shadows, fonts MUST come from the chosen theme file
  (src/ui/theme.*.json) or tailwind.config.ts which imports it.
• Import UI elements **only** from the library declared under
  "componentLibrary".  Ex:  `import { Card } from "@shadcn/ui"`.
• If you need a new token or variant not present, STOP and ask Kyser.
